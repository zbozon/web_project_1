# web_project_1

 **web_project_1** has so far been a two sprint project cuminalting as a showcase for students of Practicom by Yandex
to use as a skills list and portfolio piece. The *thoroughly comprehensive* tasks entailing the creation of each component piece of this project-website are exhaustive of the materials presented to students at the beginning of each sprint. The final projects work as an opportunity for the student to reinforce what they have learned throughout the lessons and theory portion of the sprint and apply it directly to a real-world __student instantiated__ repository and website loaded through a browser (Chrome recommended).

This repository contains code written by a Practicom by Yandex student with less than one years working development
experience and is still in need of review by Practicom cadre.
