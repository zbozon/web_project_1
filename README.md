# Web Project 1

Web Project 1 has so far been a two sprint project cuminalting as a showcase for students of Practicom by Yandex
to use as a skills list and portfolio piece. The thoroughly comprehensive tasks lists are exhaustive of the materials
students are presented with at the beginning of each sprint. The final projects at the end of each sprint are an opportunity
for the student to reinforce what they have learned through out the lessons and theory portion of the sprint and apply
it directly on a real-world student instantiated repository and website loaded through a browser (Chrome recommended).

This repository contains code written by a Practicom by Yandex student with less than one years working development
experience and is still in need of review by Practicom cadre.
